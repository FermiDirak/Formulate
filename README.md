## What is Formulate?

Formulate is a schema-driven React Forms Library that is UI agnostic (works out of the box with ant-design, material-ui, blueprintjs), type-safe for both Typescript and Flow, and easy on the eyes. The biggest selling point to Formulate is that enables you keep your form schema and your form markup separate.

Formulate handles your form's state manage and error validation, and does so with industry standard best practices built in. Never worry about error display strategies again ðŸ§ª

## Quick start Example

> See this demo in action at https://codesandbox.io/s/formulate-example-l95mp

```tsx
import useForm, {FormInput, FormArrayInput} from 'formulate';
import {isRequired, isInRange} from "formulate/validators";

// step 1: define your form schema
const formSchema = {
  name: new FormInput({initial: '', validators: [isRequired]}),
  friends: new FormArrayInput({initial: ''}),
  profile: {
    birthday: new FormInput<date | null>({
      initial: null,
      validators: [isRequired, isInRange(0, 120)]
    }),
  },
};

function Form () {
  // step 2: retrieve your form data and input bindings
  const {formData, formInputs, errors, handleSubmit} = useForm(formSchema);
  const onSubmit = handleSubmit(() => alert(`submitted: ${formData}`));

  // step 3: bind your input bindings to your markup
  return (
    <form onSubmit={onSubmit}>
      {errors.map(error => <p>{error}</p>)}

      <input type="text" {...formInputs.name.props} placeholder="name" />
      {formInput.name.errors.map(error => <p>{error}</p>)}

      {/* form input arrays allow the user to dynamically add and remove items */}
      {formInputs.friends.map((friend, i) => (
        <>
          <input
            key={friend.hash}
            {...friend.props}
            placeholder={`friend ${i}`}
          />
          {friend.errors.map(error => <p>{error}</p>)}
          <button type="button" onClick={() => formInputs.friends.remove(i)}>Remove friend</button>
        </>
      ))}

      <button type="button" onClick={() => formInputs.friends.add()}>add friend</button>
      <button type="button" onClick={() => formInputs.friends.removeLast()}>remove last friend</button>

      <input type="date" {...formInputs.profile.birthday.props} placeholder="birthday" />
      {formInputs.profile.birthday.errors.map(error => <p>{error}</p>)}

      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

## How does it work?

Otherwise, this section will walk you through how Formulate to get started with Formulate:

### Defining your Schema

The form schema dictates what fields your form will have, the shape of your form's data, and how validation is performed on each of your form inputs. There are two top level APIs you'll use when building a form schema: `FormInput` and `FormArrayInput`.

```tsx
const newsletterFormSchema = {
  email: new FormInput({
    /** The initial value that will be used to populate the input  */
    initial: "",
    /** a set of validators that will create error messages if input data is incorrect  */
    validators: [isRequired, isValidEmail],
  }),

  /** FormArrayInputs have dynamic lengths and allow inputs to be added / removed by the user */
  subscribeTo: new FormArrayInput({initial: ""}),
}
```

After defining your form schema, pass it into `useForm` to access your form state and input bindings.

```tsx
function NewsletterForm() {
  const {
    /** The current state of your form's data. Matching the shape of formSchema */
    formData,
    /** Bindings for your inputs. Matching the shape of formSchema.
     *  Used to hook up input props and error messages */
    formInputs,
    /** Form level errors. Populated on onSubmit */
    errors,
    /** Wrap your `onSubmit` in handleSubmit */
    handleSubmit,
  } = useForm(newsletterFormSchema);
  ...
```

Now all that's left is to hook up for form bindings and data to your JSX markup! This separation of form state and markup is what allows Formulate to be design-system agnostic.

```tsx
return (
  <form onSubmit={handleSubmit(() => alert(JSON.stringify(formData)))}>
    {errors.map(error => <p>{error}</p>)}

    <input type="text" {...formInputs.email.props} />
    {formInput.email.errors.map(error => <p>{error}</p>)}

    {formInputs.subscribeTo.map((subscribee, i) => (
      <>
        <input type="text" {...subscribee.props} />
        <button type="button" onClick={() => formInputs.subscribeTo.remove(i)}>Remove {i}</button>
        {subscribee.errors.map(error => <p>{error}</p>)}
      </>
    ))}

    <button type="button" onClick={() => formInputs.subscribeTo.add()}>Add</button>
    <button type="button" onClick={() => formInputs.subscribeTo.removeLast()}>Remove Last</button>

    <button type="submit"/>
  </form>
);
```

That's it! Happy hacking! ðŸ§ª

## Install

```
npm install -S formulate
```

## Comparison to React-Formik

React Formulate is differentiated from react-formik in that it was designed from the ground up for react-hooks and type soundness. There are no render props and no DSL `Field` wrappers you need to wrap your inputs in. This allows Formulate to work right out of the box with any design system. Formulate also takes a batteries attached approach with respect to form validation, and no configuration is required for setting up when form errors are displayed.

## Comparison to React-Hook-Form

Formulate is a controlled library, meaning during every render you'll have perfect information about the state of your form, and can update and read from your form from the outside. Formulate also requires no hooking up of refs, and keeps a clean separation between your form schema definition and your markup, never mixing the two.
